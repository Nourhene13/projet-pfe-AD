Implementing an IAM and PAM Strategy to Secure Access in an Active Directory Environment

🚀 Sprints Overview
**Sprint 1: Risk Analysis & Active Directory Vulnerabilities
Active Directory:A Comprehensive Overview
Common Active Directory Attacks & Mitigations: 
Kerberoasting, DCSync, Golden Ticket, Pass-the-Hash, NTLM Relay, etc.
Vulnerabilities in Misconfigured AD Environments:
Weak password policies, over-permissioned accounts, misconfigured delegation

**Sprint 2: Identity & Access Management (IAM) Strategy
Identity Lifecycle Management in AD: 
Provisioning and deprovisioning best practices
Automated Identity Provisioning & Deprovisioning Tools: 
PowerShell automation & third-party IAM solutions
🔒 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Integration:
